# Hanto
Individual Software Project created for OOAD homework assignment.
Christopher Navarro

  This Java project is based on the mobile app game Hanto/Hive, a two-player strategy game played on a hexagonal board. This projectâ€™s focus was entirely on the Object-Oriented analysis and design of the game, and how it could be best implemented. There are different versions of the game, such as: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc. Each version implements a slightly different rule set, which alters how pieces can be played, and how they move. The project covers game logic only with no UI; however, each version was built using TTD development, and was tested with multiple JUnit test cases.
